This is my master's degree thesis, on the theme of web application security.

In this paper I explain common vulnerabilities and propose elegant solutions to fix them (XSS/SQL injections, command injections, DOS, ...).

Vulnerabilities are not only technical related matters, it is also an issue at the users and the business level.

I also explain how to set up an intrusion detection policy.

This paper is written in French.
